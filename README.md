KissAnime - Download Link Collector
======================

DESCRIPTION
======================

If you're a free user on Kissanime and want to download multiple episodes at once, you would need to open each episode page individually to click the download links. This bookmarklet will facilitate that process by listing the download links together on the same page. From there, you can save them manually or use a download manager. I use DownThemAll!.

Note: An alternative use is to watch the episodes from the new page without ads or any extra content.

USAGE
======================

```
javascript:(function(){var%20script=window.document.createElement("script");script.src="https://rawgit.com/moisesnake/KissAnime-DLC/master/kissanime.js";document.body.appendChild(script);window.document.getElementsByTagName("head")[0].appendChild(script);})();
```
1. Create a bookmarklet. Name it something you'll remember (KissAnime-DLC) and paste the above javascript in the 'Location' field.

2. Make sure you're logged into KissAnime. Make a free account if necessary.

3. Go to the main episode page of the anime you want to download.

4. Click the bookmarklet.

5. wait, and a page will open with all availabe download links.
